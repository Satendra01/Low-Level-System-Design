This is a notification service implementation.

Bridge pattern is used to implement this example. If there are multiple types of notifications 
like text,QRcode etc. and there are multiple ways to send the notifications like email,SMS,etc..
Then it becomes N*M combinations of classes. To reduce the number of classes approx to N+M
bridge design pattern is used.

Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of 
closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and 
implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
